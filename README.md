## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Gabby! I've been studying and practicing art and creating since I was nine.

- I am currently working on a personal project involving space cities and robots inspired by 80s horror movies and retro futurism.
- I am also currently learning 3D modeling and would like to persue a career involving it.
- I do 2D digital art that mostly surrounds my own characters.
